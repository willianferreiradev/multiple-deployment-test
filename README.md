# Multiple Deploy Test

This is a simple project to demonstrate multiple deploys on vercel.

An application that can have different colors, titles, sizes in different domains, you can easily configure it using vercel
As easy as this is, here's an example of how it really works

## But how to do it?
- Create as many projects as needed (in vercel) from a single repository
- Use environment variables in your repository
- To succeed, your variables must have the following prefix: **NEXT_PUBLIC_**
- add variables in .env (only localhost)
- Add these variables from the project settings (vercel)
- Do deploy
- Be happy ðŸ˜Š
